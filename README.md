# GoldenEye-007-Multiplayer-TC
This is the GoldenEye 007 Multiplayer TC for Zandronum

This mod tries to do it's best to bring GoldenEye's mechanics faithfully to Zandronum, albeit with concessions due to limitations of the engine, and balancing for Mouse/Keyboard play and higher player counts.

You can compile local builds of this mod by running GEGIT.BAT. If you want to apply a GIT revision number to the PK3 file, you'll need to make sure you have GIT for Windows installed, with GIT's directory in your PATH variable.
